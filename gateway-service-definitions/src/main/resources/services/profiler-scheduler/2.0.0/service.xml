        <shortDesc>Data Catalog - Profiler Scheduler API</shortDesc>
        <description>Data Catalog includes a profiler engine that can run data profiling operations as a pipeline on data located in multiple data lakes. 
            You can install the profiler agent in a data lake and set up a specific schedule to generate various types of data profiles. 
            Data profilers generate metadata annotations on the assets for various purposes.
            When you create an Asset Collection, all data assets in that collection are added to a scheduler in the profiler backend agent.</description>
