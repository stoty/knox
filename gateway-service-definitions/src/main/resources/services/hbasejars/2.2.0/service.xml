    <!-- This is extremely important yet looks out of place. Knox IN rules ending in {**} will drop a trailing-slash
         character which will result in the HTTP/302 redirect to a URL with a trailing-slash that Jetty does with
         the ResourceHandler. Without this custom dispatch to re-add that trailing-slash, Knox will create in
         redirect-loop when trying to traverse this via the UI. This is only important when traversing the dirlisting
         via a browser or HTTP client. Maven does not traverse the directory structure when pulling artifacts.-->
