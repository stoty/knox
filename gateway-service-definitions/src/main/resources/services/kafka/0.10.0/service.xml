        <description>Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform which provides the following three key capabilities: 
            1.) Publish and subscribe to streams of records, similar to a message queue or enterprise messaging system.
            2.) Store streams of records in a fault-tolerant durable way.
            3.) Process streams of records as they occur.</description>
